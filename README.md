# Student Grade Tracker

Welcome to the Student Grade Tracker project! This Java application leverages the ArrayList data structure to manage and analyze student grades efficiently. Users can input their marks and subject names, and the application calculates the sum of all marks, average, grade, and GPA.

## Features

- **Add Marks and Subjects**: Input and store student marks and subject names.
- **Calculate Total Marks**: Computes the sum of all entered marks.
- **Calculate Average Marks**: Determines the average mark of all subjects.
- **Determine Grade**: Provides a letter grade based on average marks.
- **Calculate GPA**: Computes the Grade Point Average based on marks.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the application to start the student grade tracking.
2. **Add Marks and Subjects**:
    - Enter the subject name and corresponding mark when prompted.
3. **View Results**:
    - **Total Marks**: Displays the sum of all marks.
    - **Average Marks**: Shows the average mark.
    - **Grade**: Provides the grade based on average marks.
    - **GPA**: Displays the computed Grade Point Average.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a brief example of how the application might be used:

1. **Input**:
    ```
    Subject: Mathematics
    Marks: 85
    ```

2. **Input**:
    ```
    Subject: Science
    Marks: 90
    ```

3. **Results**:
    ```
    Total Marks: 175
    Average Marks: 87.5
    Grade: A
    GPA: 3.8
    ```

## Future Developments

This project is ongoing and aims to include additional features such as:
- Enhanced user interface.
- Support for multiple semesters or courses.
- Exporting results to a file.
